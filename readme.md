## Overview

**Project Title**: Student Records

**Project Description**: An SQL relational database to register student records, such as their personal information and school details.

**Project Goals**: Creating a space to save students information while learning how to make a database in SQLite and Python.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Download the Python extension for VS Code
2. Import sqlite to use the commands and create the database inside this program
3. Click the run button in the program

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ One of the things I plan to fix is the organization of my files. I have noticed how important it is to keep everything in its own space, creating different files with functions that only pass a result so it is easier to maintain the code.]
* [ I am planning to improve this project by adding a password so people don't have the ability to delete or create tables unless they have a higher access and avoid ruining the data.]
